/**
 * the Card class represents a card in the Set game - it consists 
 * of 1-3 groups of 1-3 characters, which come in 3 varieties. Each of the
 * groups is surrounded by one of three bracket types. On any one card, 
 * there is only one character, but it is likely to be repeated.
 * Likewise, there might be several groups of characters, but each group 
 * on a given card will have the same number of cards.
 * The following are legal cards:
 *    [**] [**] [**] (3 groups of 2 stars in square brackets)
 *    <o> <o> (2 groups of 1 circle in angle brackets)
 *    {•••} (1 group of 3 dots in curly brackets)
 *    <•••> <•••> <•••> (3 groups of three dots in angle brackets)
 * (An analogy might be working out on a nautilus machine - you do a 
 * certain number of sets of a certain number of reps of some weight,
 * on varying machines.)
 * The following are NOT legal cards:
 *    {*} {**} {***} (different size groups on one card)
 *    [o] [•] [•] (different shapes on one card)
 *    <**> <**> {**} (different brackets on one card)
 *    [oooo] [oooo] (more than three in a group)
 *    <•> <•> <•> <•> (more than three groups)
 *      (empty card)
 * So each card can be represented by four numbers - the number of groups, 
 * the size of the groups, which bracket and which icon you are using.
 * Question: how many legal combinations are there???
